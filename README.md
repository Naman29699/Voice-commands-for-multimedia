This model uses Speech Recognition to evauate what is being said through the microphone. 
We can assign keywords to do particular tasks in media players. I have used the keyboard shortcuts on VLC media player to facilitate this.
Just install speech_recognition and pyautogui and run this script and you are good to go.
